# Tip Calculator

In this challenge, proposed by the mentor frontend, the objective is to build a tip calculator, where you can change the bill amount, the tip percentage, and the number of people to divide the total amount. The result that should be returned will be the tip amount divided by the number of people and the total amount of the bill divided by the number of people.
